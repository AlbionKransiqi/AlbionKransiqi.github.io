I am a graduating senior at [Minerva Schools at KGI](https://www.minerva.kgi.edu/) with a Bachelor of Arts in Data Science and Political Sciences. I am an incoming data science intern at [Dexcom](https://www.dexcom.com/) for summer 2021. I currently work as a technical support specialist at [Minerva Project](https://www.minervaproject.com/). Previously, I worked as a data scientist intern at [Nokia Corporation](https://www.nokia.com/); a summer scholar at [Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research](https://www.novartis.com/); a teaching assistant at [Future Class Network](https://hundred.org/en/innovations/future-class-network); an admission processor at [Minerva Project](https://www.minervaproject.com/).

Outside of data science, I crochet, read, travel, and cook delicious vegan meals. 
I am passionate about social entrepreneurship and impactful tech in areas such as climate change, reproductive justice, gender equality, and sustainable development.
